Insecure passwords
Imagine you are writing a program that analyses is the password provided by a user is strong enough. We will provide a method that will be invoked like

PasswordChecker.check_password(email, password)
This method will email the user if the password is not secure.

The password will not be secure is one of the following is not fulfilled:

The password is shorter than 7 characters
The password contains a letter, a number and a symbol
The password contains some uppercase and lowercase letter
The password does not contain nor the name on the email nor the domain of the email. For example: rafa@ironhack.com -> password 12rafaT$LLL is not valid.
Please, TDD the solution. You can mock the email service.
