Pretty printer
Problem Description
Printing the contents of an array is always a pain in the ass. Write a class that has a method that receives an array and prints it beautifully in the console.

For example if you have an array like this

a_hash = {key: "value", other_key: "other_value"}
a_date = Date.today

PrettyPrinter.new.print(["My", 3, a_hash, a_date, ["Pied", "Piper"] ])
the output should be something like the following

Array:
  My
  3
  Hash:
    key -> value
    other_key -> other_value
  12-07-2014
  Array:
    Pied
    Piper
If you receive an object you don't know how to print you should show an error message instead. For example:

class A
end

Prettyprinter.new.print([A.new])
Should output

Array:
    An object I don't know how to print
Hints:

To know the type of an object you can use .is_a? method.
Suggested iterations
Create a printed that accepts an object and prints it or an error. This should only print the arrays as before or errors.
Add the printer for strings and numbers and add it to the printer before
Add the printer for dates
Create a printer for arrays that just prints each element
Make the printing recursive. This means you can print an array inside an array
Add the printer for hashes. Can this print a hash if the key or the value is an object?
Extra ball
If possible, make the printing customizable easily. This means that somebody can print the date in a different format or add information about the size of the array easily.
