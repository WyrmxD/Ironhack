<i>You can't keep me from it.</i>

2
00:00:01,278 --> 00:00:02,209
<i>From what?</i>

3
00:00:02,284 --> 00:00:03,371
<i>From what always happens.</i>

00:00:03,427 --> 00:00:06,241
<i>Previously on AMC's
The Walking Dead...</i>

5
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,025
<i>What was your son's name?</i>

6
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,288
Andre.

7
00:00:10,418 --> 00:00:12,969
What we're willing to do
is <i>not</i> my call.

8
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:15,846
<i>I got another plans...</i>

9
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:18,302
<i>involving dirt and cucumbers.</i>

10
00:00:18,384 --> 00:00:19,756
We can all live together,

11
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:21,175
<i>and nobody dies.</i>

12
00:00:21,274 --> 00:00:22,279
Liar.

13
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:24,766
No!

kinds of things just to stay alive!</i>

16
00:00:58,962 --> 00:01:01,397
Hi, Daddy.

17
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,467
You're a sight for sore eyes.

18
00:01:07,674 --> 00:01:10,616
- Doing okay?
- Yeah.

19
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:12,350
Yes, sir.

20
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,789
- Any trouble?
- No.

21
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:20,129
- You had some.
- Yeah.

22
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:21,665
A little.

23
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:28,079
Carol, I'll take that.

00:03:07,918 --> 00:03:11,120
How hungry are you,
scale of one to 10?

26
00:03:11,122 --> 00:03:12,621
15.

27
00:03:14,123 --> 00:03:15,457
28.

28
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:18,058
Yeah.

29
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,126
Well, it's been a while.

30
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:22,729
I'm gonna go check the snares.

31
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,328
Can I go with you?

32
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,299
Well, how else
are you gonna learn?

33
00:03:32,937 --> 00:03:35,170
Hey, you, too.

34
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,453
We'll stay another day or two.

35
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:52,222
Get some more rest.

36
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:54,525
Finish healing up?

37
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:56,660
I'm almost there.

38
00:03:58,964 --> 00:04:01,499
We're close now, right?

39
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:03,065
To Terminus?

40
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:04,896
- Yeah.
- We are.

41
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:10,135
When we get there,

42
00:04:10,137 --> 00:04:12,635
are we gonna tell them?

43
00:04:12,637 --> 00:04:14,403
Tell them what?

44
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,605
Everything that's
happened to us.

45
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:20,607
All the stuff we've done.

46
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:24,512
Are we gonna tell them
the truth?

47
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:28,512
We're gonna tell them
who we are.

48
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:31,215
But how do you say that?
I mean...

49
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:35,785
who are we?

50
00:04:56,704 --> 00:04:58,973
There you go.

51
00:05:00,944 --> 00:05:02,879
It's a small one.

52
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:05,248
It'll do.

53
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:11,687
So, this is just
a simple slipknot.

54
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:13,389
Tie one on both ends,

55
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:15,592
then you tighten
one side to a branch.

56
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:17,761
Now, you see how
the ground here

57
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:19,864
is sort of like a funnel shape?

58
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:22,468
- It's a trail?
- That's right.

59
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,004
That's where you want
to set the noose.

60
00:05:25,006 --> 00:05:26,105
So you hide it with leaves.

61
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:28,237
Then you put sticks
all around it

62
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,839
so any animals going by
have to run this way

63
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:32,909
right into the trap.

64
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:35,411
<i>Help!</i>

65
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:37,511
- <i> Somebody help!</i>
- Carl.

66
00:05:37,513 --> 00:05:40,546
- Carl, stop! Carl!
<i>- Get back! Back!</i>

67
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,250
<i>Help!</i>

68
00:05:43,252 --> 00:05:44,952
<i>Get away!</i>
<i>Get back!</i>

69
00:05:44,954 --> 00:05:46,922
Help!
Somebody help!

70
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:49,156
Help me!

71
00:05:49,158 --> 00:05:51,361
<i>Get away!</i>

72
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:52,896
<i>No!</i>

73
00:05:52,898 --> 00:05:54,364
Get away!

74
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:57,434
- Help! Somebody help!
- We can't help him.

75
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:06,077
<i>No! No! No!</i>

76
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,080
No!

77
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:10,281
We've got to go.

78
00:06:38,676 --> 00:06:41,444
Morning.

79
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:43,479
Everything okay?

80
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:46,179
Yeah, just want a little
help with something.

81
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:49,015
What time is it?

82
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:52,181
I never know what time
it is anymore.

83
00:06:52,183 --> 00:06:54,150
Ever since I gave
Glenn my watch,

84
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:56,419
it's always right now to me.

85
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:57,986
It's early.

86
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,054
He's decent.

87
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,588
- Morning.
- Morning.

88
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,290
Bethy's gonna take Judith.

89
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:10,960
<i>What are we doing?</i>

90
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:13,129
You'll see.

91
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:14,798
You're not going to need that.

92
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:18,268
It'll just get in the way.

93
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:31,748
<i>Let's go.</i>

94
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:41,390
Thought maybe there'd
be some houses down this way.

95
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:43,392
Maybe even a store.

96
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:48,033
There's got to be some food
around here somewhere.

97
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,035
Hey, look.

98
00:08:30,154 --> 00:08:32,890
That was one small rabbit.

99
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:34,692
It was something.

100
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:37,997
Got to hand it to the thing.

101
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:39,332
It traveled well.

102
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:45,541
Have you noticed that's all
we talk about anymore?

103
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:47,343
Food.

104
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:51,582
I forgot what this feels like.

105
00:08:51,584 --> 00:08:54,385
Me, too.

106
00:08:54,387 --> 00:08:56,588
I hope we're able
to forget again soon.

107
00:08:58,057 --> 00:08:59,557
We're close.

108
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:02,226
Just got to make it
through another day.

109
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:07,798
If folks there are taking people
in, they have to be strong.

110
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,300
They have to have a system.

111
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:13,503
I wonder if
the whole thing's legit.

112
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:29,589
We let people in.

113
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:31,424
We did.

114
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:33,226
So did the Governor.

115
00:09:35,765 --> 00:09:38,370
Yeah, it's always
the same, isn't it?

116
00:09:38,372 --> 00:09:40,606
Don't get to know
until we know.

117
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:44,545
Maybe this place
isn't even there anymore.

118
00:09:44,547 --> 00:09:47,115
Oh, dearie me.

119
00:09:47,117 --> 00:09:50,051
You screwed up, asshole.

120
00:09:51,455 --> 00:09:53,990
You hear me?
You screwed up.

121
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,846
Today is a day
of reckoning, sir.

122
00:10:06,848 --> 00:10:08,548
Restitution.

123
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,253
A balancing of the whole
damn universe.

124
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:19,663
Shit, and I was thinking
of turning in for the night

125
00:10:19,665 --> 00:10:23,304
on New Year's Eve.

126
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:26,574
Now who's gonna count down the
ball dropper with me, huh?

127
00:10:26,576 --> 00:10:29,675
10 Mississippi.

128
00:10:29,677 --> 00:10:31,308
<i>Nine Mississippi.</i>

129
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,745
- Eight Mississippi.
<i>- Joe!</i>

130
00:10:45,157 --> 00:10:48,496
- Hold up.
- You're stopping me on eight, Daryl.

131
00:10:51,368 --> 00:10:53,834
Just hold up.

132
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:56,337
This is the guy that killed Lou,
so we got nothing to talk about.

133
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:59,676
The thing about nowadays
is we got nothing but time.

134
00:10:59,678 --> 00:11:02,010
Say your piece, Daryl.

135
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,010
These people,

136
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:08,579
you're gonna let 'em go.

137
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:10,450
These are good people.

138
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,824
Now, I think Lou would
disagree with you on that.

139
00:11:14,826 --> 00:11:16,692
I'll, of course, have to
speak for him and all

140
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:19,327
'cause your friend here
strangled him in a bathroom.

141
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:25,735
You want blood, I get it.

142
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:31,671
Take it from me, man.

143
00:11:31,673 --> 00:11:34,105
Come on.

144
00:11:38,442 --> 00:11:41,510
This man killed our friend.

145
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:43,877
You say he's good people.

146
00:11:45,012 --> 00:11:48,645
See, now that
right there is a lie.

147
00:11:50,146 --> 00:11:51,980
<i>It's a lie!</i>

148
00:11:51,982 --> 00:11:53,914
- Come on.
- No!

149
00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:58,685
Teach him, fellas.
Teach him all the way.

150
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,689
- No!
- Come here, boy.

151
00:12:03,691 --> 00:12:05,992
You leave him be!

152
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,762
Shh.

153
00:12:09,764 --> 00:12:12,767
You'll get yours.
You just wait your turn.

154
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:15,901
Listen, it was me.
It was just me.

155
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:19,639
See, now that's right.
That's not some damn lie.

156
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:21,875
Look, we can settle this.
We're reasonable men.

157
00:12:24,546 --> 00:12:26,746
First, we're gonna beat
Daryl to death.

158
00:12:26,748 --> 00:12:29,149
Then we'll have the girl.

159
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:31,251
Then the boy.

160
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:34,190
Then I'm gonna shoot you
and then we'll be square.

161
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,401
Let him go.

162
00:12:44,403 --> 00:12:46,369
Stop your squirming.

163
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:54,313
Let him go.

164
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:14,771
I got him.

165
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:16,739
Oh, it's gonna be
so much worse now.

166
00:13:22,045 --> 00:13:23,143
Shh.

167
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,920
Come on, get up!

168
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:42,657
Come on.
Let's see what you got.

169
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:45,392
Shh.

170
00:13:48,463 --> 00:13:51,800
- Get away from him before I--
- Huh? Right over here.

171
00:13:51,802 --> 00:13:53,970
What the hell are you
gonna do now, sport?

172
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:19,767
I'll kill him.
I'll-- I'll kill him!

173
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:20,901
Let the boy go.

174
00:14:28,112 --> 00:14:30,047
He's mine.

175
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:34,015
Stay back.
Stay--

176
00:14:34,017 --> 00:14:35,714
Please--

177
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:08,857
<i>Here.</i>

178
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:13,817
What is?

179
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:17,319
Those feral pigs in the forest,

180
00:15:17,321 --> 00:15:19,889
it doesn't take much
to domesticate them.

181
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:22,392
Same with the horses
we've seen.

182
00:15:22,394 --> 00:15:25,733
We have seeds. We can
grow our own food.

183
00:15:25,735 --> 00:15:27,969
It's time we started planting.

184
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:30,305
Okay.

185
00:15:32,043 --> 00:15:34,246
Can't do it myself.

186
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:38,051
I got to go out there.

187
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:40,650
Go on runs, be at the fences.

188
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:44,489
I teach you how to do this.

189
00:15:44,491 --> 00:15:46,691
You teach Carl.

190
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:48,926
We're going to be here a while.

191
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:51,830
They need me.

192
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:53,832
We've been here two months.

193
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:56,133
You've made it work.

194
00:15:56,135 --> 00:15:57,769
The war is over, Rick.

195
00:15:57,771 --> 00:15:59,940
No, we don't know that.

196
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:02,542
I'm talking about you.

197
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,915
I'm saying it,
and I'm saying this,

198
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:09,350
you pull Carl back
from going out there, fine.

199
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:12,288
- He shot that boy.
- Yeah, I know.

200
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,990
He needs his father.

201
00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:18,059
He needs his father
to show him the way.

202
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:21,195
What way are you
going to show him?

203
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:24,234
He can shoot, we know that.

204
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:27,103
What's his life going to be?

205
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:29,536
What's yours?

206
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:33,275
All this.

207
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:40,681
I'm just saying everything

208
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:42,316
because I owe you.

209
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:45,684
We all owe you.

210
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,885
We can make this better now.

211
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:54,119
Things changing in here

212
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:56,521
doesn't change
things out there.

213
00:16:56,523 --> 00:16:58,824
No, it doesn't.

214
00:16:58,826 --> 00:17:01,759
But we're here today,
right now.

215
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:03,658
This is a good place to start.

216
00:17:07,997 --> 00:17:10,432
There's a run soon.

217
00:17:10,434 --> 00:17:13,068
- I got to go.
- No, you don't.

218
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:16,976
We should save it to drink.

219
00:18:16,978 --> 00:18:19,816
You can't see yourself, he can.

220
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:33,557
I didn't know what they were.

221
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:37,497
How'd you wind up with them?

222
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:40,165
I was with Beth.

223
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:43,902
We got out together.

224
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:48,375
I was with her for a while.

225
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:55,152
Is she dead?

226
00:18:57,722 --> 00:18:59,657
She's just gone.

227
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:06,370
<i>After that,</i>

228
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:08,505
<i>that's when they found me.</i>

229
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:10,408
I mean, I knew they were bad,

230
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,410
but they had a code.

231
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:17,349
It was simple.

232
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:21,922
Stupid, but it was something.

233
00:19:21,924 --> 00:19:23,422
It was enough.

234
00:19:23,424 --> 00:19:25,556
And you were alone.

235
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:29,729
They said they were looking
for some guy.

236
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:35,403
Last night they said
they spotted him.

237
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:38,572
I was hanging back.
I was gonna leave.

238
00:19:38,574 --> 00:19:40,840
But I stayed.

239
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:46,447
That's when I saw
it was you three.

240
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:50,215
Right when you saw me.

241
00:19:54,189 --> 00:19:57,723
I didn't know
what they could do.

242
00:20:03,128 --> 00:20:05,330
It's not on you, Daryl.

243
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:09,799
Hey.

244
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:11,467
It's not on you.

245
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:17,306
You being back
with us here, now,

246
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:19,240
that's everything.

247
00:20:26,681 --> 00:20:29,083
You're my brother.

248
00:20:43,129 --> 00:20:45,331
Hey, what you did last night...

249
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:49,468
anybody would have done that.

250
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,004
No, not that.

251
00:20:58,946 --> 00:21:02,450
Something happened.

252
00:21:02,452 --> 00:21:03,952
That ain't you.

253
00:21:03,954 --> 00:21:07,388
Daryl, you saw
what I did to Tyreese.

254
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,623
<i>It ain't all of it,</i>
<i>but that's me.</i>

255
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,460
<i>That's why I'm here now.</i>

256
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:15,131
<i>That's why Carl is.</i>

257
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:17,299
<i>I want to keep him safe.</i>

258
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:21,802
<i>That's all that matters.</i>

259
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:40,124
You okay?

260
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:42,027
Yeah.

261
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:49,539
I'm okay.

262
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,310
I know.

263
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,981
How?

264
00:21:58,152 --> 00:22:00,352
'Cause I'm okay, too.

265
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,867
We're getting close.

266
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:17,868
Be there before sundown.

267
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,369
Now we head through the woods.

268
00:22:20,371 --> 00:22:22,273
We don't know who they are.

269
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:23,641
All right.

270
00:22:55,148 --> 00:22:57,249
We all spread out,

271
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,984
watch for a while,
see what we see,

272
00:22:59,986 --> 00:23:02,887
and get ready.

273
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:04,755
We all stay close.

274
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:08,159
You want to stick with me?

275
00:23:08,161 --> 00:23:10,595
It's all right.

276
00:23:19,537 --> 00:23:22,073
Why didn't you go
with your dad?

277
00:23:31,087 --> 00:23:34,388
When I told you about Andre,

278
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,094
you never asked how he died.

279
00:23:37,096 --> 00:23:39,097
I knew why.

280
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:42,430
Yeah, but the how is important.

281
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:45,836
We went to a refugee camp.

282
00:23:47,907 --> 00:23:50,576
Andre and my boyfriend Mike,

283
00:23:50,578 --> 00:23:52,712
that was Andre's father,

284
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:55,045
and our friend Terry.

285
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:56,849
At the camp,

286
00:23:56,851 --> 00:23:59,953
it just got worse and worse.

287
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:01,756
People were leaving.

288
00:24:01,758 --> 00:24:03,258
People giving up.

289
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:06,427
But I didn't.

290
00:24:07,897 --> 00:24:10,300
<i>I was coming back from a run.</i>

291
00:24:13,538 --> 00:24:15,805
I saw the fences were down.

292
00:24:17,775 --> 00:24:20,110
I heard the moans.

293
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,648
It was over.

294
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,351
And Mike and Terry,

295
00:24:26,353 --> 00:24:28,420
they were high
when it happened.

296
00:24:31,158 --> 00:24:33,091
They were bit.

297
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:37,593
Could have stopped it.

298
00:24:37,595 --> 00:24:39,730
Could have killed them.

299
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,901
But I let them turn.

300
00:24:45,838 --> 00:24:47,940
I made it
so they couldn't bite,

301
00:24:47,942 --> 00:24:50,043
couldn't scratch.

302
00:24:50,045 --> 00:24:51,913
I tied chains
around their necks.

303
00:24:51,915 --> 00:24:54,748
It was insane.

304
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,516
It was sick.

305
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,420
It felt like what I deserved,

306
00:25:00,422 --> 00:25:04,654
dragging them around
so that I would always know.

307
00:25:04,656 --> 00:25:07,459
I found out that
they kept me safe.

308
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:13,194
They hid me.

309
00:25:13,196 --> 00:25:16,866
The walkers didn't
see me anymore.

310
00:25:16,868 --> 00:25:18,768
I was just another monster.

311
00:25:20,502 --> 00:25:22,968
And I was.

312
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:25,071
Me.

313
00:25:25,073 --> 00:25:28,604
I was gone for a long time.

314
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:34,878
But then Andrea
brought me back.

315
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,280
Your dad brought me back.

316
00:25:39,482 --> 00:25:41,582
You did.

317
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:50,355
I see how you've been
looking at your dad.

318
00:25:50,357 --> 00:25:53,492
You don't have
to be afraid of me

319
00:25:53,494 --> 00:25:55,994
or him.

320
00:26:01,004 --> 00:26:03,538
He told me the other day

321
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,774
that he was proud of me.

322
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:10,149
That I was a good man.

323
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,650
I'm not.

324
00:26:11,652 --> 00:26:14,819
- Carl.
- I know more now.

325
00:26:14,821 --> 00:26:17,492
About what he wanted from me.

326
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:19,328
And I tried, but...

327
00:26:21,098 --> 00:26:23,334
I still have these thoughts.

328
00:26:30,847 --> 00:26:33,718
I'm not what he thinks I am.

329
00:26:37,288 --> 00:26:39,987
I'm just another monster, too.

330
00:27:27,596 --> 00:27:29,397
Just in case.

331
00:27:57,903 --> 00:27:59,902
<i>Terminus--</i>

332
00:27:59,904 --> 00:28:02,634
<i>those who arrive survive.</i>

333
00:28:02,636 --> 00:28:04,136
<i>Follow the tracks to the point</i>

334
00:28:04,138 --> 00:28:06,607
where all lines intersect.

335
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:08,575
There are maps at the crossings

336
00:28:08,577 --> 00:28:11,275
<i>to help guide you</i>
<i>with your journey.</i>

337
00:28:11,277 --> 00:28:14,147
<i>Sanctuary for all.</i>

338
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:16,483
<i>Community for all.</i>

339
00:28:16,485 --> 00:28:19,018
Those who arrive survive.

340
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,356
Terminus, sanctuary for all.

341
00:28:22,358 --> 00:28:23,857
- Community for all.
- Hello.

342
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:25,358
Those who s--

343
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,659
Hello.

344
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:34,706
Well, I bet Albert
is on perimeter watch.

345
00:28:41,747 --> 00:28:43,613
You here to rob us?

346
00:28:43,615 --> 00:28:45,749
No.

347
00:28:47,587 --> 00:28:50,786
We wanted to see you
before you saw us.

348
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,892
Makes sense.

349
00:28:56,894 --> 00:28:58,830
Usually we do this
where the tracks meet.

350
00:28:58,832 --> 00:29:00,667
Ahem.

351
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:03,003
Welcome to Terminus.

352
00:29:04,472 --> 00:29:07,340
I'm Gareth.

353
00:29:07,342 --> 00:29:09,912
Looks like you've been
on the road for a good bit.

354
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,248
We have.

355
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:17,088
Rick. That's Carl,
Daryl, Michonne.

356
00:29:21,763 --> 00:29:23,297
You're nervous.
I get it.

357
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:26,001
We were all the same way.

358
00:29:26,003 --> 00:29:28,772
We came here for sanctuary.

359
00:29:28,774 --> 00:29:30,408
That what you're here for?

360
00:29:31,577 --> 00:29:32,809
Yes.

361
00:29:32,811 --> 00:29:34,542
Good.

362
00:29:34,544 --> 00:29:37,213
You found it.
Hey, Alex.

363
00:29:37,215 --> 00:29:39,748
This isn't as pretty
as the front.

364
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,316
We got nothing to hide,
but welcome wagon

365
00:29:41,318 --> 00:29:44,018
is a whole lot nicer.

366
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,354
Alex will take you,
ask you a few questions.

367
00:29:46,356 --> 00:29:49,156
Uh, but first,

368
00:29:49,158 --> 00:29:51,659
we need to see
everyone's weapons.

369
00:29:51,661 --> 00:29:53,861
If you could just lay them
down in front of you.

370
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:07,775
All right.

371
00:30:07,777 --> 00:30:10,377
- I'm sure you understand.
- Yes, I do.

372
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:22,223
I'd hate to see the other guy.

373
00:30:22,225 --> 00:30:23,958
You would.

374
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:29,396
- They deserve it?
- Yes.

375
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,765
Just so you know, we aren't
those kind of people,

376
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,735
but we aren't stupid either.

377
00:30:36,737 --> 00:30:40,676
And you shouldn't be stupid
enough to try anything stupid.

378
00:30:40,678 --> 00:30:42,977
As long as everyone's clear on that,
we shouldn't have any problems.

379
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:45,681
Just solutions.

380
00:30:46,884 --> 00:30:48,452
Okay.

381
00:31:07,613 --> 00:31:09,314
Follow me.

382
00:31:16,952 --> 00:31:19,187
So how long's
this place been here?

383
00:31:19,189 --> 00:31:21,487
Since almost the start.

384
00:31:21,489 --> 00:31:23,420
When all the camps got overrun,

385
00:31:23,422 --> 00:31:25,155
people started
finding this place.

386
00:31:25,157 --> 00:31:27,858
I think it was instinct,
you know?

387
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,327
Follow a path.

388
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:31,829
<i>Some folks were</i>
<i>heading to the coast,</i>

389
00:31:31,831 --> 00:31:34,063
others out west or up north,

390
00:31:34,065 --> 00:31:36,964
but they all wound up here.

391
00:31:36,966 --> 00:31:38,764
Hi.

392
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:41,734
Heard you came in
the back door. Smart.

393
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:43,503
You'll fit right in here.

394
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:48,602
Hey, Mary, would you fix each of
these new folks a plate for me?

395
00:31:49,838 --> 00:31:52,208
<i>Why do you do it?</i>

396
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,011
Why do you let people in?

397
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:57,283
The more people become a
part of us, we get stronger.

398
00:31:57,285 --> 00:32:00,020
<i>That's why we put up the signs,</i>

399
00:32:00,022 --> 00:32:02,390
<i>invite people in.</i>

400
00:32:02,392 --> 00:32:04,292
<i>It's how we survive.</i>

401
00:32:05,394 --> 00:32:07,062
Here.

402
00:32:17,174 --> 00:32:18,740
No.

403
00:32:25,784 --> 00:32:28,020
Where the hell
did you get this watch?

404
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:55,670
- Hey, Patrick.
- Hey, Mr. Grimes.

405
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:57,539
Thanks for grabbing these.

406
00:32:57,541 --> 00:33:00,245
Well, I thought
Carl might want 'em.

407
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:03,551
They were just sitting there.

408
00:33:04,753 --> 00:33:06,920
I figured it had been a while.

409
00:33:09,357 --> 00:33:12,226
I'm not ashamed that
they're for ages four to 12.

410
00:33:12,228 --> 00:33:13,728
You shouldn't be.

411
00:33:22,506 --> 00:33:24,507
Hey.

412
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:26,077
Hey.

413
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:43,824
- Carl.
- Yes?

414
00:33:46,027 --> 00:33:48,429
Carl.

415
00:33:48,431 --> 00:33:51,132
I need your help
with something.

416
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:55,972
<i>Leave it behind.</i>

417
00:33:55,974 --> 00:33:57,574
What?

418
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,450
It'll just get in the way.

419
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,055
<i>Where the hell did
you get this watch?</i>

420
00:34:09,057 --> 00:34:11,258
You want answers?
You want anything else?

421
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,294
You get 'em when
you put down the gun.

422
00:34:13,296 --> 00:34:15,764
I see your man on the
roof with a sniper rifle.

423
00:34:15,766 --> 00:34:18,167
How good's his aim?
Where'd you get the watch?

424
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,476
- Where'd you get the watch?!
- Don't do anything!

425
00:34:25,478 --> 00:34:28,480
I have this!
You just put it down.

426
00:34:28,482 --> 00:34:30,316
You put it down!

427
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,019
You want to listen to me.
There's a lot of us.

428
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:35,889
Where did you get the watch?

429
00:34:35,891 --> 00:34:37,391
I got it off of a dead one.

430
00:34:37,393 --> 00:34:38,926
I didn't think he'd need it.

431
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:43,532
<i>What about the riot gear?
The poncho?</i>

432
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:46,436
Got the riot gear
off a dead cop.

433
00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:48,405
Found the poncho
on a clothesline.

434
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:52,744
- Gareth, we can wait.
- Shut up, Alex.

435
00:34:52,746 --> 00:34:54,346
You talk to me.

436
00:34:56,884 --> 00:34:58,552
What's there left to say?

437
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,087
You don't trust us anymore.

438
00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:02,290
- Gareth.
- Shut up.

439
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:04,726
- Gareth, please.
- It's okay.

440
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,495
It's okay.

441
00:35:07,764 --> 00:35:09,265
Rick, what do you want?

442
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:11,168
Where are our people?

443
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,070
You didn't answer the question.

444
00:35:14,074 --> 00:35:15,840
<i>- Go, go!</i>
<i>- Hey!</i>

445
00:35:17,845 --> 00:35:19,779
Carl!

446
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:21,948
Get down, now!
Go!

447
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,118
<i>Shots fired in the main.
Heading into the building.</i>

448
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,621
Come on!

449
00:35:32,596 --> 00:35:34,364
Come on!

450
00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:43,309
Here!

451
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:56,159
<i>Stay on your shot.</i>

452
00:36:01,533 --> 00:36:04,436
- Come on, this way.
<i>- Get them off B!</i>

453
00:36:15,451 --> 00:36:18,087
<i>- Help! Help!</i>
- What the hell?

454
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:20,456
<i>Let us out!</i>

455
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:22,058
- <i> Help!</i>
- Keep going.

456
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,727
<i>Help!</i>

457
00:36:29,602 --> 00:36:31,738
What the hell is this place?

458
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,876
These people, I don't think
they're trying to kill us.

459
00:36:35,878 --> 00:36:38,346
<i>No, they were
aiming at our feet.</i>

460
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:42,184
There.

461
00:36:46,558 --> 00:36:48,592
There.

462
00:36:48,594 --> 00:36:50,061
Go!

463
00:37:27,323 --> 00:37:31,293
Drop your weapons! Now!

464
00:37:42,939 --> 00:37:45,107
<i>Now!</i>

465
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:54,016
Ringleader, go to your left.

466
00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:56,185
<i>The train car, go.</i>

467
00:37:58,655 --> 00:38:00,923
You do what we say,
the boy goes with you.

468
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:04,860
Anything else, he dies and
you end up in there anyway.

469
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,841
Now the archer.

470
00:38:28,251 --> 00:38:30,385
Now the samurai.

471
00:38:55,177 --> 00:38:57,812
Stand at the door, ringleader,

472
00:38:57,814 --> 00:39:00,415
archer, samurai, in that order.

473
00:39:06,021 --> 00:39:08,289
My son.

474
00:39:11,126 --> 00:39:13,061
Go, kid.

475
00:39:20,169 --> 00:39:23,304
<i>Ringleader, open the
door and go in.</i>

476
00:39:23,306 --> 00:39:25,239
I'll go in with him.

477
00:39:25,241 --> 00:39:26,941
Don't make us kill him now.

478
00:40:21,963 --> 00:40:23,763
Rick?

479
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:30,203
You're here.

480
00:40:35,342 --> 00:40:37,110
You're here.

481
00:40:51,091 --> 00:40:53,126
They're our friends.

482
00:40:56,263 --> 00:40:58,398
They helped save us.

483
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,267
Yeah.

484
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:04,070
Now they're friends of ours.

485
00:41:04,072 --> 00:41:06,506
For however long that'll be.

486
00:41:07,874 --> 00:41:09,709
No.

487
00:41:19,052 --> 00:41:22,188
There you go, Judith.

488
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,956
There you go.

489
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,361
Put it in at more of an angle.

490
00:41:33,633 --> 00:41:36,235
Whoa.

491
00:41:36,237 --> 00:41:39,004
Gonna have to get you
a farming hat.

492
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:42,808
There's a new sheriff in town.

493
00:41:44,845 --> 00:41:46,879
- How's it look?
- Looks good.

494
00:41:51,317 --> 00:41:53,986
It can be like this
all the time.

495
00:41:56,189 --> 00:41:58,190
It's like this now.

496
00:41:59,926 --> 00:42:01,526
That's enough.

497
00:42:10,169 --> 00:42:13,872
They're gonna feel pretty
stupid when they find out.

498
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:19,110
Find out what?

499
